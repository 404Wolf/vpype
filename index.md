### Continuous benchmarking

vpype CI is setup with continuous benchmarking thanks to [pytest-benchmark](https://pytest-benchmark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and the [GitHub Action for Continuous Benchmarking](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/continuous-benchmark).

➡️ See the [benchmark](dev/bench/) page for the results.
